# Data Structures in Java

This repository contains my implementations of fundamental data structures in Java. The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of data structures, improve my problem-solving skills, and gain hands-on experience with their practical applications.

## Implemented Data Structures

- **Arrays & Linked Lists**  
  - Dynamic Array  
  - Singly Linked List  
  - Doubly Linked List  
  - Circular Linked List  

- **Stacks & Queues**  
  - Stack (Array & Linked List Implementations)  
  - Queue (Array & Linked List Implementations)  
  - Priority Queue  

- **Trees**  
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)  
  - AVL Tree  
  - Heap (Min & Max)  

- **Graphs**  
  - Adjacency Matrix & List Representations  
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)  

- **Hashing**  
  - HashMap  
  - HashSet  

## How to Use

To compile and run any of the data structure implementations, use the following commands:

```sh
javac src/datastructures/Stack.java
java src/datastructures/Stack
